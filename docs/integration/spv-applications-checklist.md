# SPV Applications Integration Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures successful integration of the SPV Applications module
with the Partisipro frontend and backend systems.

## Backend Integration Tasks

### üìã Database Setup (TODO)

- [ ] Create Firebase indexes for optimal query performance:

  ```javascript
  // spv_applications collection indexes
  {
    fields: [
      { fieldPath: 'userId', order: 'ASCENDING' },
      { fieldPath: 'status', order: 'ASCENDING' },
    ];
  }
  {
    fields: [
      { fieldPath: 'status', order: 'ASCENDING' },
      { fieldPath: 'submittedDate', order: 'DESCENDING' },
    ];
  }

  // approved_spvs collection indexes
  {
    fields: [
      { fieldPath: 'status', order: 'ASCENDING' },
      { fieldPath: 'approvedDate', order: 'DESCENDING' },
    ];
  }
  ```

- [ ] Configure Firebase security rules for SPV collections:

  ```javascript
  // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own applications
  match /spv_applications/{applicationId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  }

  // Allow admins to read/write all applications
  match /spv_applications/{applicationId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
      get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
  }
  ```

### üìß Email Template Setup (TODO)

- [ ] Configure SendGrid templates:

  }

  async getSPVStats() {
    return await apiClient.get('/api/spv-applications/stats');
  }

  async reviewSPVApplication(applicationId: string, action: 'approve' | 'reject', notes?: string) {
    return await apiClient.post('/api/spv-applications/review', {

      reviewNotes: notes
    });
  }
  ```
